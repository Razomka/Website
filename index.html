            <h2>I love the smell of... Bread in the Morning</h2>
            <p>
                Ah! Hello there! I see that the exotic smells of the spices and the comforting smell of baking have
                wafted their
                way through the internet to lure you here!
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, Welcome to Cooking with James Goring and if you hadn't guessed, I am James Goring himself.
                Novice...nay, amateur chef and professional baker.
                I shall be taking you through a journey of various recipes that I like to indulge in. Before all that
                though! If you don't think I'm a real person then please go ahead and read all about me <a
                    href="Webpages/AboutMe.html">
                    here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lets start with the first recipe I want to offer - <a href="Webpages/WhiteLoaf.html"> A delicious plain white
                    loaf</a>,
                in a tin and free-form. While quite basic, it is a professional standard! Make a good white loaf and people will come running!
            </p>
