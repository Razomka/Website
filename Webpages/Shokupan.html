            <h2> Tasty and Sweet, The <i lang="ja">Shokupan</i> Loaf! </h2>
            <h3>A Little History Of <i lang="ja">Shokupan</i> And Tips On Making It</h3>
            <p>Or if you want to <a href="#recipe">jump straight to the recipe!</a> Been here, read that.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>If you are planning on making this. Be wary that the yudane should be done the night
                    before.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i lang="ja">Shokupan</i> is a delicious, soft, sweet and fluffy white bread from Japan. It is said to
                orginate
                from the
                1880s
                made by a British baker, but is highly different from our regular loaves. This is due to the inclusion
                of milk
                and a
                special but simple ingredient called a <i lang="ja">yudane</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <i lang="ja">yudane</i> is just simply bread flour mixed with either water or milk and heated to
                around 65&deg;C
                and
                this
                makes the starch more gelatinious. This is then torn up and added to a simple white loaf recipe. This
                allows
                the
                loaf to become extra fluffy but also adds a slight sweetness, combine this with milk, you end up
                with an
                excellent loaf.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've included the baker's percentages below and I would like to mention that the <i lang="ja">yudane</i>
                is 20% of
                the flour, so if you are using 500g of flour then the <i lang="ja">yudane</i> will be 100g and your
                flour for the
                loaf will be 400g.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that you know a little about it, lets start with the recipe.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--Same as before, if you take this whole article part, then someone should be able to follow it and make their own loaf without the context of the rest of the webpage.
        That's why I have it as an article, if I split it into two parts, ingredients and instructions then they would be sections.-->
        <article id="recipe">
            <h3>First It Begins With The <i lang="ja">Yudane</i></h3>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <p><i lang="ja">Shokupan</i> in a 900g sized tin</p>
            <p><i lang="ja">The Yudane</i></p>
            <p><strong>The <i lang="ja">yudane</i> should be done the NIGHT BEFORE or 8-12 HOURS BEFORE.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>100g Strong White Flour</li>
                <li>100ml Boiling Water</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Pop your strong white flour into a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add your boiled water and then mix together until it comes together as a ball.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with some cling film and then either leave aside or pop into the fridge for at
                    <b>least 8
                        hours</b>.
                </li>

            <p>And that's step one of the recipe. Not very hard but very important.</p>

            <h3>Onto the <i lang="ja">Shokupan</i> Loaf</h3>
            <p><strong>Be sure to have the <i lang="ja">yudane</i> done prior!</strong></p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <p>Continuing our <i lang="ja">Shokupan</i> Loaf</p>
            <ul>
                <li>400g Strong White Flour</li>
                <li>30g Sugar</li>
                <li>6g Instant Dried Yeast</li>
                <li>10g Salt</li>
                <li>20g Butter</li>
                <li>250ml Lukewarm Milk</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Get your ingredients ready including the <i lang="ja">yudane</i> made yesterday or at least 8 hours
                    ago.</li>
                <li>Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the salt & sugar to one side and the yeast to the other side.</li>
                <li>Add the <i lang="ja">yudane</i> by tearing it into small pieces and adding to your flour.</li>
                <li>Add your butter and then slowly add the milk while mixing, you can use a spoon or your hands.</li>
                <li>When the ingredients start to come together, form it into a very rough ball.</li>
                <li>Set aside your mixing bowl and spread a small handful of flour over where you shall knead your dough.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and place onto the floured worktop and start kneading. Knead
                    for
                    at least 10mins.</li>
                <li>When the dough begins to form a smooth outer skin, try the windowpane test.</li>
                <li>Add a little oil to a new bowl and place your kneaded dough into it.</li>
                <li>Add a dish cloth or something similar over the top and leave the bowl in a warm area for at least an
                    hour.
                </li>
                <li>After the hour, flour your worktop and add a little oil or butter to your loaf tin.</li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and on your worktop, fold it onto
                    itself until you have removed the air within.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into two or three pieces of equal weight. Leave this to rest under a cloth for 20mins.</li>
                <li>After 20mins, take the first piece and flatten it using a rolling pin into a loose rectangle, making sure two
                    edges
                    are longer than the other</li>
                <li>Roughly measure the width of your loaf tin. Our flatten dough will have the same width</li>
                <li>We do this by rotating the dough so that the shortest edge is closest to you and tightly folding the
                    long edges into the middle making sure that the dough has a similar length to your tin</li>
                <li>Now tightly roll up the loaf starting at the closest edge to you like a swiss roll</li>
                <li>Place this seam side down into your prepared loaf tin on one side</li>
                <li>Repeat this step for the other pieces and placing those onto the other side then one in the
                    middle(if you did 3 pieces)</li>
                <li>Cover with the dish cloth and leave for 30mins</li>
                <li>Before the 30min mark, pre-heat your oven to 185&deg;C (fan-over) or 200&deg;C Convential, you'll
                    know yourself
                    how
                    long this takes. Mine takes 10 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove the dish cloth and if you feeling fancy, you can brush some beaten egg over the top.</li>
                <li>Bake the loaf for 25-30mins</li>
                <li>Check the loaf after 25-30mins and see if the top is a lovely golden brown then remove it.</li>
                <li>Take the loaf out of the tin and tap the bottom to check if it sounds hollow, if it does then rest
                    it on
                    a
                    cooling rack. If it doesn't then place back into the oven without the tin for a few more minutes, I
                    usually
                    go for 7-10mins</li>
                <li>After cooling, cut it into large thick slices and eat it as you please!</li>

            <h3> The baker's precentages for this recipe</h3>
            <p>
                As <i lang="ja">shokupan</i> is usually made within a tin, it is very useful to know how to scale it up
                or down to
                fit into different tins.

                Remember that with this recipe, the <i lang="ja">yudane</i> is 20% of your total flour and the rest is
                used to be
                mixed with the milk.
            </p>
            <table>

        <p>This recipe has been slightly modified from this recipe here at <a href="https://www.chopstickchronicles.com/shokupan-japanese-fluffy-white-bread/">Shokupan By Chopstick Chronicles</a></p>
        <p>My technique is different as I like to hand knead my loaves, so I modified my recipe to account for that. But do check our their website, it is very good!</p>
