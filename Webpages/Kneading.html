            <h2> How to Knead Your Bread! </h2>

            <p>
                Here are some guidelines on how to knead your loaf. Kind of like "How To Train Your Dragon" but less
                cool...
            </p>
            <p> Please read them first and watch the video to
                further
                understand them.
                It isn't hard and more importantly, you will learn your own style that will suit you. My style might not
                suit
                you
                and that is fine but please do learn the concept.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>When you have mixed your ingredients together, you shall have a rough ball of dough. It might be
                    sticky and that's okay.</li>
                <li>Add a little flour or oil to your surface. Flour will create a drier loaf but easier to clean up and
                    helps prevent too much stickiness!</li>
                <li>Place your ball of dough onto the surface and pin it down with any hand. I use my left hand as I'm
                    right-handed.</li>
                <li>Next push upwards using the ball of your spare hand. This will stretch the dough. Be sure not to
                    stretch
                    too
                    far or you might tear the dough. </li>
                <li>Next I like to grab the stretched dough and fold it back itself. Do not worry about the dough
                    sticking
                    to
                    your hands, it will start to become less sticky after more kneading.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough slightly clockwise or anticlockwise (choose one or the other) and repeat this
                    technique for 5 to 10mins until the
                    dough
                    has a nice smooth skin.</li>
                <li>The more pressure you apply on the palm push, the quicker you will work your dough. This is also
                    true
                    with
                    how quickly you repeat these steps.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                And that is kneading, it's incredibly simple.
                The science is that you are strengthening the gluten strands by stretching them around without tearing
                them.
                However, if you do tear it, it is not an issue at all. You can just fold it back into the dough and
                continue.

                <h3>The Smooth Skin</h3>
                <p>
                    A kneaded dough will visably look different to an unkneaded dough. One of the key identifiers is the
                    smooth
                    skin
                    that will be created from kneading.
                    if we compare these two pictures:

                        alt="A picture of the dough after kneading, looking much smoother and more like a ball." />

                <p>
                    We can easily see the second picture is different from the first and actually, that dough could have
                    been further
                    kneaded to further smooth the dough.
                    One nice thing about hand kneading dough is that it is very hard to over-knead it, this is not true
                    if
                    you
                    use a
                    machine to knead your dough. Machines are far more powerful.

            <h3>Give It A Poke</h3>
            <p>And if it springs back then we know that it is doing well. Here's a little video demonstrating what I
                mean.

            <h3> The Windowpane Test</h3>

            <p>
                You have might of heard of this simple test. It is a quick way to see if how far you have
                gotten
                along with your kneading.
                It isn't completely conclusive, so don't use it to completely determine if you have finished your
                kneading. Do all 3 checks!

                But here is the idea.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/windowpane.jpg" title="I'll be having glass in my windows!"
                    alt="A piece of dough being stretched between fingers and it is blocking a light source." />
                <figcaption>The Windowpane Test, it's easy enough like!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <ol>
                <li>Remove a large piece of your kneaded dough, enough to stretch apart.</li>
                <li>Hold up the piece to a light source and block the light. An indoor light or a window will do.</li>
                <li>Take both sides of the piece and stretch it out slowly. If your dough has been well kneaded then it
                    should
                    stretch thin enough to see some light shine through.</li>
                <li>You should be able to do this without ripping the dough.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                And that's it. It allows you quickly check after doing the other checks to tell if you have done a
                decent
                job of
                kneading. Now, onto how to <b>shape</b> your loaf! An extremely important step.

            <h2>How to <b>Shape</b> Your Bread!</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Shaping</b> the dough is one of the most important steps. I would also argue more important than
                kneading/proving
                combined! Okay, that might be a slight exaggeration but it is definitely important to learn good
                techniques
                when
                possible.
                I'll be showing you both styles for free-form and for placing into a loaf tin.

                Here's a photo of my lovely white loaf that I made recently.
            </p>

            <figure>

                    alt="A picture of the kneaded dough sitting in a bowl with a tea towel covering the bowl." />
                <figcaption>See the split? That is due to poor shaping but overall looking tasty!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                However, as you can see. It split across the bread, while this doesn't effect the taste it does look
                sloppy.
                This
                was due to my poor shaping!

                My excuses are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Dough was far to sticky, I added too much water (I've lowered the water for the recipe).</li>
                <li>I must have been lazy!</li>
                <li>I didn't even follow my own technique, which doesn't build trust in you with my skills but at least
                    I'm
                    honest!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Moving on... Here is the technique for tinned loaves. I'll be assuming that your work surface is floured
                and
                the
                bread is properly kneaded and proved.

        <section>
            <h3><b>Shaping</b> A Tinned Loaf</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove your proved dough and <b>knock back</b> the air out of it, which is folding it onto
                    itself repeatly until it is similar in size before it was proved.</li>

                <li><b>Shape</b> it into a rough circle by using the sides of both hands and tucking the sides in while
                    rotating.</li>

                <li>When it is a circle, push down to flatten it and stretch it out to create an oblong rectangle.</li>

                <li>Fold the two far sides into the middle and push this down tightly.</li>

                <li>Take the longest edge closest to you and start to tightly roll it up like a swiss roll. This will
                    create a
                    seam/join
                    running across on the base of your dough.</li>

                <li>Place this seam down into your oiled/buttered tin.</li>

                    And that should give you nice tinned loaf. Make sure when you are rolling it, make it nice and
                    tight.
                    You'll get use to the practice when you attempt it often.

            <h3><b>Shaping</b> A Free-Form Loaf - The Bloomer</h3>
            <p>
                This is for a bloomer shaped loaf, something you might be familiar with if you ever gotten a "bakery"
                loaf from
                the
                supermarket.
                This is identical to <b>shaping</b> a tinned loaf. The key difference is when rolling it up. This time
                you
                want to be
                much
                softer.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove your proved dough and <b>knock back</b> the air out of it, which is folding it onto
                    itself
                    repeatly until it is similar in size prior to proving.</li>
                <li><b>Shape</b> it into a rough circle by using the sides of both hands and tucking the sides in while
                    rotating.
                </li>
                <li>When it is a circle, push down to flatten it and stretch it out to create an oblong rectangle.</li>
                <li>Fold the two far sides into the middle and push this down.</li>
                <li>Take the longest edge closest to you and start to roll it up like a swiss roll. This will create a
                    seam/join
                    running across on the base of your dough.</li>
                <li>This seam will be base of your loaf. Place it seam down onto your baking tray.</li>
