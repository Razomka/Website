            <h2>The Little White Loaf That Could!</h2>
            <h3> These Are My Handy Little Tips Prior To The Recipe</h3>
            <p>Or if you want to <a href="#recipe">jump straight to the recipe!</a> Been here, read that.</p>
            <p>
                I'll have these tips throughout my recipes as I feel there is always something important to mention and
                I don't want to clog up the recipe with random information or tidbits.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this white loaf, while a basic recipe, it does require you to <a
                    href="Kneading.html#Kneading"><b>knead</b></a> the dough and
                <a href="Kneading.html#Shaping"><b>shape</b></a> the dough. These are important steps but easy to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unfamiliar with <b>kneading</b> and <b>shaping</b>. I would like to redirect you to this page
                <a href="Kneading.html">here</a>.
                This page contains both instructions and videos on how to <a
                    href="Kneading.html#Kneading"><b>knead</b></a> and <a href="Kneading.html#Shaping"><b>shape</b></a>
                your bread.
            </p>
            <p>
                There isn't really anything to else to say as the recipe is nice and basic. So I'll talk about an useful
                concept called baker's percentages.
            </p>

            <h3>Baker's percentages</h3>

            <p>
                I only recently learnt about these and they are very useful, particularly for bread making, and not too
                difficult to understand!
            </p>
            <p>
                The way they work is that you break down the components into percentages against the main ingredient. In
                our
                case, this would be strong white flour.
                Might not make sense for now, but bear with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                My loaf below uses 400g of strong white flour. So that is 100%. Now I use 260ml of water, so to figure
                out the percentage of water to flour.
            <p>
                It would be as follows: 260/400 * 100 = 65% Water.
            </p>
            <p>
                After getting the percentages of each ingredient. You can start using these percentages to upscale the
                size of your loaf, while maintaining the same texture as before!
            </p>
            <p>
                Want to make 3 x 300g loaves? Then we'll need 900g flour, then 65% of 900g to get our water volume. Voila! Now
                you can make any loaf of any size!
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll include the baker's percentages into all my baking recipes if you ever want to ever scale up or
                down
                with
                the
                ingredients.

                <li>Add a dish cloth or something similar over the top and leave the bowl in a warm area for at least an

                <li>After the hour, flour your worktop, remove the dough from the bowl and on your worktop, fold it onto

                <li>Cover with the dish cloth and leave for 30mins.</li>
                <li>Before the 30min mark, pre-heat your oven to 200&deg;C Fan Oven or 220&deg;C Conventional, you'll
                    know
                    yourself
                    how
                    long this takes. Mine takes 10mins.</li>
                <li>Remove the dish cloth and do a few slashes across the top of the loaf with a sharp knife and then
                    pop
                    into
                    the oven for 30-40mins.</li>
                <li>Check the loaf after 30-40mins and see if the top is a lovely golden brown then remove it.</li>
                <li>Take the loaf out of the tin and tap the bottom to check if it sounds hollow, if it does then rest
                    it on
                    a
                    cooling rack. If it doesn't then place back into the oven without the tin for a few more minutes, I
                    usually
                    go for 7-10mins.</li>
                <li>After cooling, enjoy it with some tasty butter or your favourite spreads! You can also toast it and
                    it
                    will
                    taste great.</li>

            <h3>The Baker's Percentages For This Recipe</h3>

            <p>
                For my recipe, I used the following percentages. Useful if you want to scale up to a larger loaf or
                multiple loaves.
            </p>

            <table>

                <tr>
                    <td>Strong White Flour</td>
