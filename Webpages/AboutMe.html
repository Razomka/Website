            <h2>About James Goring</h2>
            <p>
                James Goring was an average person who worked for his wage and did various jobs in his life. One of
                those
                jobs
                was working away in a bakery, a job that he particularly enjoyed. Early mornings and an early finish
                time,
                what's
                not to love?
            </p>
            <p>
                However, James couldn't sustain himself on just minimum wage, actually he is surprised that
                <strong>anyone can
                    sustain
                    themselves on minimum wage.</strong> <strong>The government should really force the hand of larger
                    employers to pay a
                    decent wage</strong>,
                but
                he doesn't need to say this as the pandemic really left corporations short-changed with workers. They
                say
                that karma is circular.

                Anyways, James Goring is a mature student (i.e. in his 30s) and giving it his best shot to become
                something
                more
                than
                just minimum wage. More importantly, it is something he is geniunely interested in and that course is
                <i>Computer
                    Sciences</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For one of his modules, he has been tasked with creating the most exciting and interesting website and
                what
                more exiciting than baked goods? Obviously <i>Computer Sciences</i> but he couldn't possibly bang on
                about that. So instead he is doing baked goods, luckily something he has experience in.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that's enough about him, lets get back to baking. Can I recommend the simple but tasty <a
